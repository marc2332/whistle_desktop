A simple Desktop compiler for [Whistle](https://github.com/whistle-lang/whistle) made using [ðŸ¦• Astrodon](https://github.com/astrodon/astrodon/tree/feature/deno_tauri) and [Deno](https://deno.land/).

**Note**: Astrodon is currently being developed, therefore, it is on alpha stage and it's missing some stuff. The version used on here is from Astrodon's `feature/deno_tauri` branch.
